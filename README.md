# DBD-Perk-Roulette
Made a little randomizer for you guys


TO USE: download all files in the same folder and open index.html, DON'T mess with the other files or locations or it won't work... Choose the DLCs to be included, and also toggle perks you would like to see in the rotation. The empty perks don't look like they get added, but they do



AS OF 11/12/18: 3-perk randomizer is now working. Added in the potential to get 1/2/3/4 empty slots, and solved the duplicate error message! Net up: Locking in perks.


AS OF 11/14/18: Seriously refactored the project. Removed 3 perk randomizer, and replaced with ability to select perks to be used in next drawing! Thats a pretty solid trade in my book.
