# DBD-Perk-Roulette
Made a little randomizer for you guys
It's pretty basic, and I still would like to add in the ability to lock in a perk, or limit yourself to three /2/1. in the mean time, just do it yourself :)
AS OF 11/12/18: 3-perk randomizer is now working. Added in the potential to get 1/2/3/4 empty slots, and solved the duplicate error message! Net up: Locking in perks.
